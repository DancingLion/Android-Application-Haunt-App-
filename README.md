# Android-Application-Haunt-App
An Android "Haunt" application built for my Mobile App Developement course.

Haunt was designed to fill a gap in Kennesaw State Universityâ€™s college campus experience. 
Current students, staff, and club have difficulty in promoting events or finding events due to a lack of a centralized area for promotion. 
Paper flyers have proven inadequate in promoting events as they often times are not hung up in enough areas to inform the campus about the event. 
Paper flyers also add a cost to promotion, waste resources, and are often left up after the event is over which takes advertising room away from new events. Haunt aims to combat this frustration. 
The application may provide a one stop location for students and clubs to find and promote events in an easy to navigate application that feels natural for most smartphone users. 
This application may lead to a decrease in paper waste and overall campus frustration when it comes to missed events.
